### What is it?
A #badgelife SAO featuring science dog - now coder dog - cranking code with confidence. Comes with 4 randomly cycling multicolor LEDs on the keyboard for extra flair. Inspired by the classic "I Don’t Know What I’m Doing" meme, but this Doggo? He does.

### Why did you make it?
This was my first attempt at PCB design, and I wanted to make something simple and fun for this year's DEFCON. Unlike the meme dog in the lab, I did know what I was doing (mostly). And I hope you enjoy the result!

### What makes it special?
🐶 Inspired by meme dog, powered by vibes

💡 Cycling multicolor LEDs light up the keyboard

🔌 Standard 2x3 SAO header

🛠️ Fully assembled, plug-and-vibe

💻 Good boy’s coding now. With AI. For DEFCON33.
